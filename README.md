# House_prediction_RF
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning techniques.

#Overview
The dataset used in this project contains information about houses including their location, total square feet area, number of bathrooms, presence of balconies, price, area type, availability status, and number of bedrooms.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand the distribution of each feature, identify missing values, and explore relationships between features and the target variable (house price).

#Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning
Missing values were handled appropriately, either by imputation or removal.

#Feature Engineering
Object columns were transformed to integer values using label encoding.
Categorical variables were one-hot encoded to convert them into numerical form.
Dummy variables were created for categorical columns to prepare the data for modeling.
#Model Training
A machine learning model ( random forest, etc.) was trained using the preprocessed data to predict house prices.

#Sample Prediction
A sample prediction was performed using the trained model. Input values for various features were provided, and the model predicted the corresponding house price.
